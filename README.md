# Using the scripts 

To start using the scripts you have two options.

Option 1: Copy the script into your console window.

Option 2: Install tampermonkey (or greasemonkey if using firefox, although I have not tested thiss). Once installed, load up the script, at the top of the page you will see a raw button. (http://prntscr.com/bcjlz5) Clicking this will ask if you would like to install the script, once installed reload the game. You will also be able to get updates for scripts if you're using this method by clicking the "check for updates" button on the tampermonkey menu (http://prntscr.com/bcjmko). 

If you have any requests please feel free to mail me ingame.
